To automatically compile a ts file when save:
>> tsc <filename> --watch

Initialize typescript config file (tsconfig.json)
>> tsc --init
  * With the tsconfig file, you can run the command below to compile ts files.
  >> tsc
  * The default setting prevents compliation of ts files in "node_modules" directory.


In tsconfig.json file, you can specify
1. "exclude" property: tsfile(s)/directory(s) you don't want to compile
2. "include" property: tsfile(s)/directory(s) you only want to compile
The target ts files would be in "include" - "exclude" subset.

If "lib" property is not specified, default api's will be included (ex: dom api)
But when specified, you should write stuffs you'd need.
Check typescript documents for more details about these apis, features & more.

"sourceMap" property is super convenient when you want to
see the typescript source from the devtools in modern browsers.
It lets you see the original ts file in Source tap in devtool
via generating "~.js.map" files in your project,
which act as a bridge between typescript source file & devtool.
It even shows break points in typescript source file!

With "outDir" property, you can set a direcory of output js files.
If you set "outDir" as "./dist", all compiled js files will be saved/updated
in that "./dist" directory.

The property "rootDir" doesn't really live up to it's name
because when you set the root directory via the property, the compiler not only looks
into the root directory you've set but also outside of the directory.
"rootDir" only works as a specified name of a directory 
that the compiler would look into and make an output with the same directory structure.
It would make a lot more sense if the property name was something like "relativePathBaseDir".

If "noEmit" is set to true, compiler won't generate output.
The usecase may be when you only want to compile and check errors?

The "noEmitOnError" looks just like the property you'd want to use in
cases I described above.

"downlevelIteration" is there to solve any niche case that happens
when your output is old js version and forloops are not working properly.
